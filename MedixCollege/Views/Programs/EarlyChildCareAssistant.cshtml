        PROGRAM SUMMARY
    </h1>
    <p class="contentp">
        The Early Childcare Assistant program at Medix College provides training for individuals looking for a

        rewarding career working in the Early Childhood Assistant field. Early Childhood Assistants (under the

        guidance of the Teacher) provide a safe and nurturing environment for children that encourages their

        social, emotional, physical and intellectual development through designing and implementing a

        developmentally appropriate curriculum according to established guidelines.

        <br /><br />

        The Early Childcare Assistant program was designed to equip childcare workers with valuable

        knowledge, skills and experience for employment as Assistants in day care centres or early learning

        centres. The program was designed to give students an overview of the responsibilities of an early

        childcare assistant and opportunities to perform those duties. It presents foundational skills needed for

        those seeking to move into an Early Childhood Educator program. The Program has been developed and

        accredited by NACC.

        <br /><br />

        There are employment opportunities for graduates of the Early Childcare Assistant program in

        Brantford, Brampton, Burlington, Cambridge, Durham, Guelph, Hamilton, Kitchener, London,

        Mississauga, Markham, Milton, North York, Oakville, Oshawa, Scarborough, Toronto, Waterloo and

        other cities across southern Ontario.
