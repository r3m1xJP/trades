        <p class="contentp">
            Medix College provides training in healthcare diploma programs preparing students for the growing
            healthcare industry in Canada. The objective of the program training is to equip the students with the
            most current theory and practical training necessary to become successful healthcare professionals.

            <br /><br />

            The curriculum relies on two fundamental principles; firstly, teach to foster an understanding of the material
            versus memorization of the material, and secondly, allowing the students to process information
            through practical experience. Practical experience is provided to our students through laboratories and
            an opportunity to shadow experienced workers in the field. Each campus has its own set of programs,
            which run throughout the year.
